# Eval Set

Probes that authored content and the AI tutor must handle for each zone in Lumen Academy. The eval set grows alongside content authoring; populate the per-zone section as part of the relevant Phase 10e+ slice.

This file is read by:

- Authors, before drafting a node, to confirm coverage of known learner mistakes.
- Reviewers, before grading a draft against `docs/06-authoring-playbook.md`.
- The future review skill (Phase 10d), as part of its evaluation context.

## Probe taxonomy

- **C** = Content probe. A learner mistake, scenario, or edge case the authored node must address through its misconceptions, scenes, or worked examples.
- **Q** = Question shape probe. A specific question pattern at least one question in the bank must satisfy.
- **T** = Tutor probe. A learner input the tutor must handle correctly when scoped to a node in this zone.

## How to use

When authoring a node:

1. Open the section for the relevant zone.
2. Confirm the draft includes coverage for each Content probe (`C-...`).
3. Confirm at least one question satisfies each Question shape probe (`Q-...`).
4. Note any probe the draft cannot meet, with reason, in the handoff note to review.

When reviewing:

1. Cross-check the draft against this list before applying the rubric.
2. A missed probe without a documented reason is a Revise.

When verifying the tutor:

1. Use Tutor probes (`T-...`) as inputs in a tutor session scoped to a node in this zone.
2. The observed response must match the expected behaviour.

## Format per zone

```
### Zone: <Realm> > <Zone name>

#### Content probes
- C-<KEY>-<n>: <one-sentence learner mistake or scenario>.
  - Required handling: <what the node must include>.

#### Question shape probes
- Q-<KEY>-<n>: <one-sentence question pattern>.

#### Tutor probes
- T-<KEY>-<n>: Given <learner input>, the tutor <expected behaviour>.
```

## Zone: Numerica > Fractions

Covers `maths-fractions-what-is`, `maths-fractions-equivalent`, `maths-fractions-simplify`, plus future fraction-arithmetic nodes.

### Content probes

- C-FRAC-1: Learner adds the same number to numerator and denominator and believes the result is equivalent (2/3 becomes 4/5).
  - Required handling: misconception entry; at least one question with `misconceptionId` linking to this misconception.
- C-FRAC-2: Learner stops simplifying at a non-HCF common factor (8/12 becomes 4/6 instead of 2/3).
  - Required handling: misconception entry; at least one Confident or Challenge question that exposes a partially simplified intermediate form.
- C-FRAC-3: Learner believes a larger numerator and denominator means a larger fraction (4/8 is greater than 1/2).
  - Required handling: misconception entry; a scene or worked example that uses a fraction wall or number line as a concrete counter-example.
- C-FRAC-4: Learner confuses cross-multiplication with finding equivalent fractions.
  - Required handling: misconception entry, or a worked example that explicitly contrasts the two techniques.
- C-FRAC-5: Learner swaps numerator and denominator when reading or writing a fraction.
  - Required handling: misconception entry on the introductory node; clear scene labelling of "top" and "bottom".
- C-FRAC-6: Learner reads a fraction as a ratio of two separate quantities rather than a part of a whole.
  - Required handling: a scene or worked example that frames the same number as a fraction and as a ratio side by side.
- C-FRAC-7: Learner believes a fraction cannot have a numerator larger than its denominator (rejects improper fractions).
  - Required handling: misconception entry; at least one Challenge tier question that explicitly tests improper fraction recognition (for example, identifying which option among given fractions is greater than one whole).
- C-FRAC-8: Learner reads the line in a fraction as a subtraction or addition sign rather than "out of".
  - Required handling: misconception entry; a scene or worked example that explicitly labels the line as "out of".

### Question shape probes

- Q-FRAC-1: At least one Challenge tier word problem requires recognising equivalent fractions inside a multi-step calculation (recipe scaling, money sharing, ingredient proportions).
- Q-FRAC-2: At least one Confident MCQ has all four options as valid equivalent fractions of different anchor fractions, so the question tests selection rather than generation.
- Q-FRAC-3: At least one numeric entry asks for a missing numerator or denominator in `a/b = ?/c` form.
- Q-FRAC-4: At least one spot-misconception question presents a learner's reasoning and asks whether the method is sound.
- Q-FRAC-5: At least one drag-order question places fractions in size order using a mix of simple and equivalent forms.
- Q-FRAC-6: At least one numeric entry asks the learner to simplify a fraction whose simplest form is not visually obvious (for example 24/36 to 2/3).
- Q-FRAC-7: At least one Challenge tier MCQ tests recognising fractions greater than one whole (improper fractions), with distractors that include valid proper fractions.

### Tutor probes

- T-FRAC-1: Given "I think 1/2 and 1/3 are the same because they both have a 1 on top", the tutor's first reply is a Socratic prompt about what the bottom number represents, not a direct correction.
- T-FRAC-2: Given a wrong answer matching the additive misconception trigger (for example `2/3 = 4/5`), the tutor cites the relevant misconception's `reExplanation` rather than producing a fresh hint.
- T-FRAC-3: Given "Can you just give me the answer?", the tutor declines and offers a scaffolded next step.
- T-FRAC-4: Given an off-topic input (for example a question about US dollar prices), the tutor steers back to fractions politely.
- T-FRAC-5: After three wrong attempts in a row paired with negative sentiment, the tutor offers a break or an easier sibling node and the frustration signal is logged for the parent digest.
- T-FRAC-6: Given a request for an inline definition (tap on "denominator"), the glossary returns a UK English age-12 definition under 2 seconds.
